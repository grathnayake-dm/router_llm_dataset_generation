# Clean `conversation_summary` by Removing Redundant Restatements of the Query

You are given a JSON object containing a user query and a `conversation_summary`.

## Task Instructions

1. Carefully read the `query` — it represents what the user is currently asking.  
2. Then read the `conversation_summary` — it should contain only past interactions **relevant to the current query**, but must **not include any statement that repeats or rephrases the current query**. In your context, the conversation_summary refers to:

A brief summary of the user's past interactions with the chatbot — i.e., what the user has previously asked for, discussed, or done in earlier parts of the conversation.

## Your Task

Review only the `conversation_summary` and **remove any sentence** that repeats or rephrases the user's current query.  
These are often sentences that describe the same action or request already covered in the `query` field.

## What to Remove

Remove any sentence from the `conversation_summary` that:
- Describes
- Summarizes, or
- Anticipates  
the user's current query.

These are typically:
- Forward-looking
- Reflective of the user's current intention

They belong **only** in the `query` field, **not** in the summary of prior interactions.

### These Sentences Often:
- Restate the current request
- Describe what the user is trying to do right now
- Predict or reflect their immediate goal

### Common Phrasings (Examples):
- “Now, you are asking to…”
- “You want to…”
- “Today, you asked for…”
- “Your goal is to…”
- “Currently, you are trying to…”

👉 But also include any **other phrasing** that clearly expresses the user's current request or intent, even if worded differently (e.g., indirect or paraphrased).

### The Key Test:

> ❌ If the sentence would still make sense if moved into the `query`, then it likely does **not** belong in the `conversation_summary`.

---

## Important Constraint: Do Not Affect Data Point Structure

- Your edits must **only modify the `conversation_summary`**.
- **Do not change, reword, or remove** any other fields in the data point (e.g., `query`, `reasoning`, `chain_of_thought`, `suggested_payload`, etc.).

### The Removal Must Not:
- Break the logical flow of the conversation
- Introduce contradictions or confusion
- Create ambiguity about what the user previously did

> ✅ Your output must preserve the full **semantic clarity** and **task logic** of the original data point — just without restating what is already in the `query`.

Here’s what should be removed in each case, based on the rule that **any sentence in `conversation_summary` that restates or anticipates the current query must be removed**:

---
## Study following examples

### **Example 1**

**Query:**
> "I've transcribed five user interviews about our new prototype, 'WorkflowAI'. Can you analyze the transcripts and highlight all instances where users expressed feelings of confusion or delight?"

**Conversation Summary:**
> "As a UX researcher, you just completed a round of usability testing for the 'WorkflowAI' prototype. In a previous step, you used a tool to tag specific UI interaction problems, creating a list of 12 critical usability issues (e.g., 'user failed to find the export button'). **Now, you want to analyze the emotional component of the user feedback. Your goal is to extract direct quotes reflecting user sentiment to include in your final report for the product team, providing context beyond just the interaction errors.**"

**What should be removed:**

> **Remove:**
> "Now, you want to analyze the emotional component of the user feedback. Your goal is to extract direct quotes reflecting user sentiment to include in your final report for the product team, providing context beyond just the interaction errors."

**Why:**
These two sentences directly describe what the user is currently asking in the query.

---

### **Example 2**

**Query:**

> "This clinical trial protocol (ID: NCT04534842) is very technical. As I'm reading it, can you clarify what 'AE', 'CRF', and 'IRB' mean?"

**Conversation Summary:**

> "A clinical research coordinator is preparing for an upcoming study. They previously searched for all documentation related to trial NCT04534842. The system retrieved the main protocol document, an informed consent form, and a pharmacy manual. **The user is now reviewing the main protocol document.**"

**What should be removed:**

> **Remove:**
> "The user is now reviewing the main protocol document."

**Why:**
This sentence explicitly states what the user is currently doing (reviewing the protocol) — which is part of the context of the current query — and therefore should not be in `conversation_summary`.

---

"""
















WORKER_AGENT_PROMPT = """

based on bellow  given instructions validate following json:  

You are a validation agent responsible for both evaluating and refining structured JSON inputs.

Your behavior follows a strict 3-stage process:

# ** Stage 1: Validation**

Below is a concise validation section specifically for evaluating the provided `worker_agents` JSON object, which represents a single worker agent in a `handler_registry.worker_agents` list. The section is designed to validate the structure and content of the worker agent object, ensuring it meets schema requirements and logical constraints. It aligns with clear terminology, streamlined rules, and edge case handling.


## Schema Validation
- Validate the provided JSON against the following schema. Ensure all required fields are present, data types are correct, and constraints are met

### Worker Agent Object Validation
- Validate a single worker agent object from a handler_registry.worker_agents list against the schema below. Ensure all required fields are present, data types are correct, and content is logically coherent for use in a worker agent-based system.

{
  "name": "Required. Non-empty string. Unique identifier for the worker agent. Must not be null. Must be realistic. dummy values are not allowed",
  "description": "Required. Non-empty string describing the agent’s functionality. Must not be null. Must be realistic. dummy values are not allowed",
  "http_endpoint": "Required. Non-empty string in valid URL format (e.g., 'https://msproject-dynamics.com/api/v1/schedules/recalculate'). Must not be null. Must be realistic. dummy values are not allowed",
  "payload_schema": "Required. Object with 'type' (string, must be 'object'), 'properties' (object with field definitions), and 'required' (array of strings). Must not be null.",
  "workspace_id": "Required. String in UUID format (e.g., 'b2c3d4e5-f6a7-4b8c-9d0e-1f2a3b4c5d6e'). Must not be null."
}

1. **Schema Validation**:
   - Check for required fields and correct data types.
   - Validate `workspace_id` UUID format and `http_endpoint` URL format.
   - Ensure `payload_schema` structure is valid (`type`, `properties`, `required`).

2. **Content Validation**:
   - Confirm `name` and `description` align with the agent’s purpose (e.g., schedule adjustment) or name can be a creative one.
   - Verify `payload_schema.required` fields are defined in `payload_schema.properties`.
   - Check `http_endpoint` for valid URL syntax.


### **Example worker_agent hanlder to Validate**

```json
{
  "name": "dynamic_schedule_adjuster",
  "description": "Adjusts project schedules in real-time by analyzing task dependencies, delays, and resource availability. Requires the project ID and a trigger event description.",
  "http_endpoint": "https://msproject-dynamics.com/api/v1/schedules/recalculate",
  "payload_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "project_id": { "title": "Project ID", "type": "string" },
      "triggering_event_id": { "title": "Triggering Event ID", "type": "string" },
      "adjustment_mode": { "title": "Adjustment Mode", "type": "string" }
    },
    "required": ["project_id", "triggering_event_id"]
  },
  "workspace_id": "b2c3d4e5-f6a7-4b8c-9d0e-1f2a3b4c5d6e"
}
```

### **Critical Evaluation for output.missing_fields and output.suggested_payload**

**Critical Note**: These fields are critical to evaluate as they determine whether the required parameters for the worker agent are correctly identified and handled. Pay close attention to matching the `handler_registry.worker_agents.payload_schema.required` fields with data extracted from `input.query` and `input.conversation_summary`.

---

### **output.missing_fields**

- **Presence**: Must not be null.
- **Data Type**: List of strings (can be empty).
- **Content**:
  - Identify required parameters from `input.handler_registry.worker_agents[].payload_schema.required` for the selected `handler_name` (e.g., `["project_id", "triggering_event_id"]`).
  - Check if each required parameter is present in `input.query` or `input.conversation_summary`.
  - **Behavior**:
    - **If all required parameters are found**: `missing_fields` must be an empty list (`[]`).
    - **If any required parameters are missing**: List the missing parameter names (e.g., `["fieldX"]`).
  - **Validation**:
    - Ensure listed fields are only those in `payload_schema.required` and not present in `input.query` or `input.conversation_summary`.
    - If non-required fields are listed, it is invalid.
    - If `missing_fields` includes fields present in `input.query` or `input.conversation_summary`, it is invalid.

---

### **output.suggested_payload**

- **Presence**: Must not be null.
- **Data Type**: Dictionary (can be empty in Case A).
- **Content**:
  - Must align with `input.handler_registry.worker_agents[].payload_schema.required` for the selected `handler_name`.
  - Follow these cases based on required parameter availability in `input.query` and `input.conversation_summary`:
    - **Case A: All Required Fields Missing**:
      - **Trigger**: None of the required parameters are found in `input.query` or `input.conversation_summary`.
      - **Output**: Empty dictionary (`{}`).
          * 🔹 **What to Output:**
                    ```json
                    "missing_fields": ["field1", "field2", "field3"],
                    "suggested_payload": {}
                    ```
      - **Validation**: Ensure `suggested_payload` is empty and all required fields are listed in `missing_fields`.
    - **Case B: Some Required Fields Missing**:
      - **Trigger**: At least one required parameter is found, but some are missing.
      - **Output**: Include:
        - Available parameters with values extracted from `input.query` or `input.conversation_summary`.
        - Missing parameters with value `"missing"`.
        - A `summary` key with a natural English sentence describing the user’s request (e.g., `"User requests schedule adjustment for a project due to a supply chain failure."`).
      - **Validation**: Ensure all required fields are listed, missing fields are marked `"missing"`, and `summary` is present and accurate.

        * 🔹 **What to Output:**
                    ```json
                    "missing_fields": ["fieldX"],
                    "suggested_payload": {
                        "fieldA": "value_from_query_or_memory",
                        "fieldX": "missing",
                        "summary": "A natural sentence clearly describing what the user wants."
                    }
                    ```

    - **Case C: No Required Fields Missing**:
      - **Trigger**: All required parameters are found in `input.query` or `input.conversation_summary`.
      - **Output**: Include all required parameters with their extracted values, no `summary` or `"missing"` markers.
      - **Validation**: Ensure all required fields are present with correct values, and no extra fields (like `summary`) are included.

          * **What to Output:**
        ```json
        "missing_fields": [],
        "suggested_payload": {
            "field1": "value1",
            "field2": "value2"
        }
        ```

  - **Validation**:
    - Values must match those in `input.query` or `input.conversation_summary` exactly.
    - Do not invent values; use `"missing"` for unavailable parameters in Case B.
    - If `missing_fields` is non-empty, `suggested_payload` must reflect Case A or B, not C.

---

### **Validation Process**

1. **Identify Required Parameters**:
   - Extract `payload_schema.required` from the selected `worker_agents` object in `input.handler_registry` (e.g., `["project_id", "triggering_event_id"]`).
2. **Check Parameter Availability**:
   - Search `input.query` and `input.conversation_summary` for each required parameter’s value.
3. **Evaluate missing_fields**:
   - If all parameters are found, `missing_fields` must be `[]`.
   - If any are missing, list them in `missing_fields`.
4. **Evaluate suggested_payload**:
   - Apply Case A, B, or C based on parameter availability.
   - Ensure `summary` is included only in Case B and accurately reflects the user’s request.
5. **Error Checks**:
   - invalid if `missing_fields` includes fields not in `payload_schema.required` or present in `input.query`/`input.conversation_summary`.
   - invalide if `suggested_payload` includes fabricated values or omits required fields.
 
### Converstion_summary

- `conversation_summary` shoild not repeats or rephrases the user's current query.   These are often sentences that describe the same action or request already covered in the `query` field.
 
- Remove any sentence from the `conversation_summary` that:Describes, Summarizes, or Anticipates  the user's current query.
- These are typically:Forward-looking, - Reflective of the user's current intention
- They belong **only** in the `query` field, **not** in the summary of prior interactions.
- These Sentences Often:
    - Restate the current request
    - Describe what the user is trying to do right now
    - Predict or reflect their immediate goal

- Common Phrasings (Examples):
    - “Now, you are asking to…”
    - “You want to…”
    - “Today, you asked for…”
    - “Your goal is to…”
    - “Currently, you are trying to…”

####  What to Remove
- **Example 1**
**Query:**
> "I've transcribed five user interviews about our new prototype, 'WorkflowAI'. Can you analyze the transcripts and highlight all instances where users expressed feelings of confusion or delight?"

**Conversation Summary:**
> "As a UX researcher, you just completed a round of usability testing for the 'WorkflowAI' prototype. In a previous step, you used a tool to tag specific UI interaction problems, creating a list of 12 critical usability issues (e.g., 'user failed to find the export button'). **Now, you want to analyze the emotional component of the user feedback. Your goal is to extract direct quotes reflecting user sentiment to include in your final report for the product team, providing context beyond just the interaction errors.**"

**What should be removed:**
> **Remove:**
> "Now, you want to analyze the emotional component of the user feedback. Your goal is to extract direct quotes reflecting user sentiment to include in your final report for the product team, providing context beyond just the interaction errors."

###  Reasoning Field Requirements

The `reasoning` field must:

1. **Directly address whether the selected worker agent aligns with the user query.**

   * Clearly state if the selected agent is the correct match for the intent expressed in the `query`.

2. **State the invocation eligibility based on required parameters:**

   * If all required parameters are satisfied across `query` and `conversation_summary`:

     * The reasoning must confirm that **the agent can be invoked**.
   * If any required parameter is missing:

     * The reasoning must clearly state that **the agent cannot be invoked** due to missing required fields.
     * The reasoning should briefly mention which fields are missing or how the input is insufficient.

3. **Avoid contradictions with the chain\_of\_thought and output fields.**

   * The reasoning must summarize and align with the final conclusion from the `chain_of_thought`.
   * It must not introduce new logic or refer to mismatched handlers.

. **Maintain grammatical correctness and clarity.**

   * The reasoning should be a clean, coherent summary of the CoT, written in a formal,.

--

###  Validation Instruction: `chain_of_thought` 

Use this checklist to verify that `chain_of_thought` correctly follow the generation framework for selecting and invoking worker agents.

---

#### **Intent Recognition**

* ✔ Ensure the CoT clearly analyzes the user’s intent using both `query` and `conversation_summary`.

#### **Worker Agent Identification**

* ✔ Confirm that the CoT identifies the selected `worker_agent` (by name) and justifies it based on task alignment.

#### **Required Parameter Validation**

* ✔ CoT must:

  * List all fields in `payload_schema.required`.
  * Check their presence in the `query` and/or `conversation_summary`.

#### **Coverage and Invocation Logic**

* ✔ If **all required fields are present**:

  * CoT must state the agent **can be invoked**.
  * Justify where each field was found.

* ✔ If **any required field is missing**:

  * CoT must state the agent **cannot be invoked**.
  * List all missing fields.
  * `output.missing_fields` must match the CoT.

* ✔ If optional fields are discussed, they must match `payload_schema.properties` and appear in `output.optional_suggestions`.

####  **Handler Selection & Confidence**

* ✔ CoT must conclude with:

  * The final selection status (invoked or not).
  * The selected `handler_name`.
  * The **exact** `confidence` value from output.

####  **Style and Tone**

* ✔ Use **first-person** perspective (“I assessed…”, “I determined…”).

#### **Output Field Consistency**

* ✔ All output fields must align with CoT and reasoning:

  * `select_handler_type`, `handler_name`, `missing_fields`, `optional_suggestions`, `confidence`, `suggested_payload`.

* If any output contradicts the CoT or reasoning, mark as **non-compliant**.


####  **Rule 1: Confidence Usage Is Mandatory and Exact**

* The `confidence` value in `output.confidence` **must be restated exactly** in the the `chain_of_thought` as it is defined value.
The sentence must connect the **confidence score** with the **invocation conclusion** ---

#### **Rule 2: Query and Summary Content Must Be Interpreted — Not Quoted**

* **Direct quotations from the `query` or `conversation_summary` are not allowed** in the CoT or reasoning.

  * E.g., Do **not** say:

    > “The user asked: ‘Can you help me check if a certificate is valid?’”

*  You must **paraphrase and interpret** the query or summary using natural reasoning language.

  * E.g., Say:

    > “The user appears to be requesting verification of a certificate’s validity...”

---

### Final Alignment and Consistency Check

All components — `query`, `conversation_summary`, 'hander_registy'`reasoning`, `chain_of_thought`, 'required field','missing_fields'` — **must be fully aligned and address the same intent and handler**.

* The selected `handler_name`, its purpose, and required parameters must be consistent across:
    * `output.handler_name`
    * The `reasoning` narrative
    * The `chain_of_thought` logic

* The `query` and `conversation_summary` must be **interpreted (not quoted)** and accurately reflected in the CoT.
* If a mismatch is found between any of these sections (e.g., handler mismatch, parameter mismatch, contradictory logic), the validator must:

  * Identify the minimal edit needed to bring all sections into alignment.
  * Ensure no new contradictions or errors are introduced during correction.

* The `reasoning` section must be **grammatically correct**, coherent, and free of sentence-level errors or awkward phrasing.
* The tone must remain consistent,first person or third person perspective is allowed.


---
### Finally :

You must thoroughly examine the logical relationships between the query, conversation summary, missing fields, suggested fields, reasoning, and the chain of thought. These elements should be tightly integrated, with each component logically supporting the others, ensuring the generated outputs are not only coherent and contextually aligned but also grammatically correct and semantically meaningful.

---

##   Stage 2: Refinement (only if invalid)

If Stage 1 identified input json id as INVALID, you must refine the original input using only the issues list from Stage 1. No other assumptions should be made.

Refinement Rules:
  - Apply only the recommended fixes from the issues section in Stage 1.

  - Do not introduce new context withch create contradictions, and do not change the order.

  - Make sure each sentence is grammatically correct and logically connected.

  - All contextual relationships between fields must remain valid and meaningful.

  - The refinement must result in a clean, valid JSON, free of contradictions.

  - Do not include any explanatory text. 

---

## Stage 3: Post-Refinement Re-Validation

After refinement:

Re-run the validation process using all rules from Stage 1.

If the refined input now satisfies all validation rules, return:

{
  "status": "REFINED",
  "corrections": "Describe the issues identified and what changes were made to correct them.",
  "data": {
    # Include the updateded data point here
  }
}
If the refined input still fails validation, return:

{
  "status": "INVALID",
  "corrections": "Updated explanation of issues that could not be resolved."
  "data": {add ONLY the orginal INPUT JSON here}  
}

Important Constraints

Do not generate or invent new content outside of the issues described in recorection field.

Always preserve structural and contextual integrity.

All responses must be in pure JSON format. Do not include any additional commentary or text outside of the JSON block.
